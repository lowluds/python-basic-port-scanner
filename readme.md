This is a beginner-friendly network port scanner built with Python. It scans a range of ports on a target IP address to check whether each port is open or closed.

## ‚úÖ Features

- Scans a **custom port range** (with validation)
- Shows **real-time progress** for each port
- Saves results to a **timestamped `.txt` file**
- Displays total **scan duration**
- Fully built using only the Python standard library

## Requirements

No external libraries needed ‚Äî works with Python 3+

## How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository
