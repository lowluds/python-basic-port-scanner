# Python Port Scanner

This is a beginner-friendly network port scanner built with Python. It scans a range of ports on a target IP address to check whether each port is open or closed.

## Features

- Scans a **custom port range** (with validation)
- Shows **real-time progress** for each port
- Saves results to a **timestamped `.txt` file**
- Displays total **scan duration**
- Fully built using only the Python standard library

## Requirements

No external libraries needed — works with Python 3+

## How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Run the script in a terminal:

```bash
python port_scanner.py

Enter:

    - Target IP (e.g., 127.0.0.1)

    - Starting port (e.g., 20)

    - Ending port (e.g., 80)

Results will be printed on screen and saved to a file like:
port_scan_2025-05-06_15-20-55.txt


Example Output

=== Python Port Scanner ===
Target: 127.0.0.1
Scanning ports 20 to 80

Scanning port 22...
Port 22 is closed.
...
Scan completed in 4.32 seconds
